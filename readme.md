## Details for teaching team
I made this project in a rush and kind of did the bare minimum of what is required. I've been busy lately and haven't had time to add bells and whistles, so this project isn't a great reflection of my skills as a developer. But hey, at least it works.

## Outside code
Used badcow/lorem-ipsum <https://packagist.org/packages/badcow/lorem-ipsum> and fzaninotto/faker <https://packagist.org/packages/fzaninotto/faker>
